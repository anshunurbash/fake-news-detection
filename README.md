 fake-news-detection
Fake news classification using Machine Learning &amp; NLP
A comprehensive Fake News Detection system developed using Machine Learning models like XGBoost, along with complete NLP preprocessing pipelines. The project walks through dataset exploration, cleaning, feature extraction (TF-IDF), model building, evaluation, and saving trained models.
